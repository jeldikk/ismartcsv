A part of this data is taken from www.narl.gov.in, People at Narl work meticulously to cater different hosted instrument data to enthusiastic researchers working in atmospheric research.

The sample data taken here is just for demonstrating the features of the ismartcsv module. No effort or trials are made to gain any credits personnaly.
